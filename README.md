Made the old snake game using 8086 assembly language 
Play it on a 25x25 emulator screen.
Use 'z', 'q', 's' and 'w' keys to move the snake up, right, left and down respectively.
These letters must be lowercase.
You win when your snake's length hits 10.
It's quite slow so please be patient while playing.
if you have any comment to leave, feel free to do so.
